1) Stopped relying on PurchasesRepo.list_purchases_by_vendor(...)

Problem the test exposed: that repo method doesn’t include paid_amount or advance_payment_applied, so computing remaining_due triggered a KeyError: 'paid_amount'.

Change: I rewrote the report to query the purchases table directly for the fields it needs (purchase_id, date, total_amount, paid_amount, advance_payment_applied) and to filter by date <= as_of.

Effect: We always have the correct columns, so remaining_due = total - paid - advance_applied is reliable and the KeyError disappears.

2) Added two private helpers for correctness and clarity

_fetch_purchase_headers_as_of(vendor_id, as_of): returns exactly the header fields needed, already cut off by the as-of date and in a deterministic order.

_credit_balance_as_of(vendor_id, as_of): sums vendor_advances.amount up to the cutoff date.

Why: The test expects “available_credit” to reflect as-of balance (not “today”), and invoices included only up to the cutoff. These helpers enforce that.

3) Reworked the aging computation to be “as-of” accurate

Before: Tried to use whatever list_purchases_by_vendor returned and optionally a remaining_due key if present.

Now: Always compute remaining_due ourselves from the header fields fetched as-of; only keep invoices with remaining_due > 0; bucket by days outstanding; sum per bucket; and include available_credit computed as-of.

Effect: Matches the test’s expectations:

Bucket totals across vendors = sum of all open remaining_due.

available_credit equals the as-of vendor credit balance.

4) Made list_open_invoices(...) consistent

It also uses the same “as-of headers” helper and returns open invoices with remaining_due and days_outstanding. This wasn’t strictly required for R1, but it keeps the reporting API coherent.

5) Fixed the module location

You pointed out the package is inventory_management/modules/reporting/…, not …/reports/…. I put the file in the correct module path so pytest can import it.

Bottom line: Not just cosmetic changes. The report now:

Doesn’t break if repository methods change shape.

Computes both open balances and credit as-of the requested date (what the test checks).

Eliminates the KeyError and aligns precisely with the test’s validation logic.
